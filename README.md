# AirBnB-Project-Udacity

The following project has been created as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025 

## Motivation:
The project involved gathering the data, dealing with missing values and categorical variables and analysis to answer 3 key questions: 
  
    1. Does price of the properties infuence the review scores?
    
    2. Do properties with a flexible cancellation policy have higher review scores?
    
    3. What is the relationship between reviews and booked frequency?
    
## Files:
  The following project looks at data in the Seattle AirBnB dataset https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle.
  AirBnB_Project.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with full project analysis including data cleaning and results
  calendar.csv - dataset including AirBnB listing availability and prices
  listings.csv - dataset including information on AirBnB listings such as cancellation policy and review score
  reviews.csv - dataset including review information on AirBnB listings
  
## Results:
  A summary of results can be found in Medium artile:https://beemajaya.medium.com/the-effect-of-review-scores-on-your-airbnb-99c15c0bd37b  and within the Jupyter notebook.
  
    1. Does price of the properties infuence the review score?
  ANS
    There is a weak relationship between price and review score. It is unusual for expensive properties to have low review scores but high review scores are obtainable for cheaper properties.
    
    1. Do properties with a flexible cancellation policy have higher review scores?
  ANS
    There is a weak relationship between cancellation booking flexibility and review score with more flexible policy properties having a marginally higher review score than those with moderate policies and (to a greater extent) strict policies.
    
    1. What is the relationship between reviews and booked frequency?
   ANS:
    No, there appears to be no relationship between review score and availability.
